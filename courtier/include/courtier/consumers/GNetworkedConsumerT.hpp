/**
 * Base class for networked courtier consumers (ASIO, websocket, MPI). It owns the work machinery
 * that turns the synchronous reconcile-the-span contract of GBaseConsumerT into the asynchronous,
 * checkout/return world of remote clients -- and it does so for MANY concurrent submitters at once
 * (the fan-in design), so a population of optimization algorithms can each submit to the SAME shared
 * client pool simultaneously (e.g. a meta-optimization over a population of inner algorithms).
 *
 *  - dispatch_(items) registers the round's items as a new BATCH (the scheduling state lives ON each
 *    item -- its dispatchState -- so there are no per-item side queues; each call BORROWS the caller's
 *    round vector, it never owns/copies the items). It then blocks until every slot of ITS batch
 *    reaches DONE or that batch's adaptive give-up window elapses; items left DO_PROCESS == MISSING are
 *    resubmitted/cloned/failed by the inherited reconciliation loop.
 *  - checkout()/checkin() are the queue endpoints a transport's session calls. checkout() serves the
 *    next pending slot, round-robin INTERLEAVED across all currently-active batches (so concurrent
 *    submitters make progress together, not one whole batch after another). checkin() matches a
 *    returned (deserialized) result to its slot by id and writes it back.
 *
 * The wire correlation token is `(batch_id, slot)` -- the reincarnation of the old broker's
 * bufferport routing: batch_id selects WHICH submitter's batch a result belongs to (so two concurrent
 * batches' slot 0s never collide), slot the index within that batch. A result whose batch_id is no
 * longer active (a late arrival from a batch that already timed out / finished) is silently dropped --
 * this is what makes resubmission and lease-reclaim safe, and replaces the former per-round generation.
 *
 * Borrow contract: the
 * batch's vector is BORROWED for the duration of dispatch_; the consumer reads/serializes/schedules
 * through it but never takes ownership. The only write is checkin() swapping a slot's pointer for the
 * deserialized result -- the population stays the sole owner of its individuals.
 *
 * Timeout / death-detection (unchanged in spirit, now per batch): each dispatch_ waits until its batch
 * is DONE or progress stalls past an ADAPTIVE give-up window (a multiple of the running mean return
 * time, shared across batches). The give-up window only applies ONCE at least one result has ever been
 * received: before that, dispatch_ waits INDEFINITELY, because under a batch-scheduling system the first
 * worker may not enter the pool for minutes or hours. While waiting, where the transport has no
 * client-liveness signal
 * (usesTimeLease(), default true: ASIO/MPI), stuck in-flight items of that batch are reclaimed once
 * they exceed an adaptive LEASE. A transport that detects client death directly (the websocket
 * consumer, via its persistent session + CheckoutLease) reclaims immediately on disconnect and
 * disables the time lease.

     * distinct evaluation that simply came back too late to be used this round -- is parked instead
     * of discarded, so an optimization algorithm can reap it via getOldWorkItems() (the
     * GOptimizerExecutionPolicy reaper enables it via enableLateReturns() and drains it through
     * getLateReturns()/getOldWorkItems()). The buffer is bounded two ways: @p cap (max items held; 0 DISABLES buffering, the
     * default) and @p ttl_rounds (a held item is evicted after this many dispatch rounds). Each entry
     * carries the dispatch-round "epoch" at which it was buffered, used only for TTL eviction; the batch
     * id is a 48-bit, process-wide, non-wrapping counter, so a retired batch id is never re-minted and a
     * buffered late return can never be confused with a fresh batch. Evictions (cap or TTL) are counted
     * (lateReturnDroppedCount()) and warned once -- never silently lost.
     *
     * Results-only late returns: a work item returned in the lightweight results-only form (only its
     * computed results travel; its input parameters are grafted back from the originally-submitted item
     * -- see GProcessingContainerT::graftInputDataFrom) normally cannot be reconstructed once it arrives
     * LATE, because its batch has been reconciled and the original it would graft from is gone. To make
     * such a slow-but-alive worker's result usable, enabling this buffer ALSO makes dispatch_ retain a
     * clone of every un-returned original (keyed by correlation id, bounded by the same cap + ttl_rounds).
     * A late results-only return then grafts its input parameters from that retained original and is
     * parked like a full return; only a late results-only return with NO matching retained original (e.g.
     * one that outlived the ttl) is DROPPED (and counted in lateReturnDroppedCount()), since an
