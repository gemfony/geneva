"""Out-of-tree application build (ReleaseTestplan.md: "Out-of-tree application
build").

``build_against_install`` is the real out-of-tree consumer test: it configures
and builds the shipped 10_GStarter example as a standalone CMake project that
locates the *installed* Geneva via ``find_package(Geneva)`` (the installed
CONFIG package, with the bundled FindGeneva.cmake as fallback) and links the
``Geneva::geneva`` imported target, then runs the resulting binary. It depends
on install/make-install having populated the prefix, so it runs in the SHORT
tier (i.e. also under ``--medium``).
