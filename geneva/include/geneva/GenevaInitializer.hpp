 * A lightweight runtime-init helper, retained for backward compatibility (Go2 holds one as a member,
 * and it may still be instantiated directly). It is now largely vestigial: the global random-number
 * factory's lifecycle is owned by a single process-lifetime guard in the hap library, which brings the
 * factory online before main() and finalizes it once after main() returns (see
 * GRandomFactoryLifecycleGuard in hap/src/GRandomFactory.cpp). GenevaInitializer therefore neither owns
 * nor tears down that shared factory; its constructor merely touches it (a no-op if already up) and its
 * destructor does nothing. Crucially it must NOT finalize the factory -- it is not the factory's
 * exclusive owner, so doing so would starve every later random-number consumer.
