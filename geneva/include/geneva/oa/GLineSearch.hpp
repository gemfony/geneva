/**
 * A reusable, derivative-free-acceptance backtracking line search for descent methods. Given a base
 * point x0, a search direction dir and the directional derivative
 *
 *     g0_dot_dir = grad f(x0) . dir   (which MUST be negative for a descent direction),
 *
 * it finds a step length alpha that sufficiently decreases phi(alpha) = f(x0 + alpha*dir) under the
 * Armijo sufficient-decrease condition (Armijo, "Minimization of functions having Lipschitz continuous
 * first partial derivatives", Pacific J. Math. 16, 1966):
 *
 *     f(x0 + alpha*dir) <= f(x0) + c1 * alpha * g0_dot_dir.
 *
 * Geneva submits a whole batch of parameter sets per courtier round, so the search probes
 * `probes_per_round` trial step lengths at once -- one round per batch -- and accepts the LARGEST trial
 * step in the batch that satisfies Armijo. This is an ordinary backtracking line search, batched to fit
 * the bulk-submission model. The objective is supplied as eval_fn(points) -> values, evaluating a batch
 * of points in a single call, so it can be wired straight to the optimization algorithm's
 * broker/executor and thus runs on whatever consumer the algorithm uses (serial, multi-threaded, GPU
 * or networked) -- the line search itself is consumer-agnostic.
 *
 * The class is a transient numeric helper: it holds no optimization state and is NOT a registered
 * optimization algorithm. It is intended for reuse by any descent-style algorithm (conjugate gradient
 * descent today; others later). The mathematics is standard, published and unencumbered, and the
 * implementation is original to Geneva.
