/**
 * @brief A pluggable, process-global fault injector consulted during an individual's process().
 *
 * This is the data-oriented successor of the retired per-individual "random crash" debugging facility:
 * instead of every individual carrying a crash probability, a single injector is registered once (like a
 * pluggable optimization monitor) and consulted at evaluation time. It lets tests and diagnostics
 * deterministically -- or probabilistically, via the individual's own RNG -- simulate evaluation
 * failures, to exercise the consumer's / optimization algorithm's error-handling and recovery paths.
 *
 * The facility is geneva-side and carries NO per-individual state and NO courtier dependency. When no
 * injector is registered (the default) the consultation is a single null-pointer check, so production
 * runs pay essentially nothing.
 *
 * A returned THROW surfaces as an EXCEPTION_CAUGHT processing status (as if evaluate() threw);
 * a returned FLAG_ERROR surfaces as an ERROR_FLAGGED status (as if the individual flagged a user error).
 * Both are handled by process() exactly like a genuine evaluation failure. The transport-level
 * "worker never returns" fault is a separate, consumer-side concern and is NOT modelled here.
