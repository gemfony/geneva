/**
 * @file
 * @brief Turns GLoadableParaboloid into a runtime-loadable Geneva individual plugin.
 *
 * This whole translation unit is the "glue" a problem author writes to make an existing individual
 * loadable at runtime. It is exactly TWO pieces of registration:
 *
 *  1. BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT(GLoadableParaboloid): registers the individual's serialization GUID so it can
 *     cross the networked wire and a checkpoint (the SAME registration a compiled-in individual needs; it
 *     lives here so it is compiled into the .so). Every node that (de)serializes this individual must have
 *     this plugin loaded -- which, since server and client are the same binary loading the same .so, is
 *     automatic.
 *
 *  2. The fixed entry point geneva_module_manifest(): a small extern "C" wrapper (the loader resolves this
 *     unmangled symbol via dlsym) delegating to the typed helper individualManifest<Factory, Config, Name>(),
 *     which builds the module manifest -- the toolchain-compatibility fingerprint the loader validates first,
 *     plus one INDIVIDUAL contribution whose factory is the standard GIndividualFactory<Derived>. That is
 *     the entire author-facing surface: no Geneva macro, ordinary C++.

// config-file path (auto-created with the individual's defaults if absent), and a display name.
