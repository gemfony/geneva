/**
 * @brief The GPU marshaller for GGPUParaboloid -- shipped in the SAME loadable module as the individual.
 *
 * The paraboloid kernel (kernels/paraboloid.cu) needs no problem-specific constants and every item flattens
 * the same way, so this marshaller adds nothing to the base scaffolding: @c GBaseGPUMarshallerT<double>
 * already supplies @c itemDimension() / @c flatten() / @c scatter() / @c scalarKind() in pure host code
 * (the device math is the runtime-compiled kernel, not this class). It exists only so the module has a
 * concrete marshaller type to contribute to the marshaller store under the "cuda" device target, which is
 * what lets Go2 build the GPU consumer around this problem for @c --consumer @c gpu.
