# This script will start a given Geneva program a predefined
# number of times in client mode on the same host. It will also
# start the server, using Geneva's standard syntax for networked mode.
# This can be used to test networked execution of a Geneva program
# using local (i.e. reliable, low latency) networking.
# Note that if your program opens many connections to the server,
# e.g. because it uses a large number of individuals and cycles,
# you might quickly run out of local ports (max 64k). See the
# Geneva FAQ for an advice in this situation.
