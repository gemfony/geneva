Geneva library - Examples
=========================

This directory contains some examples of how to use the Geneva library for
performing parametric optimization. You will also find here some more complete
programs, which are intended as starting points for your own work.

The following examples are provided:

01_GSimpleOptimizer:
--------------------

This example is meant as the first starting point for exploring Geneva. It provides
easy command line access to the minimization of various mathematical functions, through
different algorithms.

02_GParaboloid2D:
-----------------

The main purpose of this example is to provide users with a first insight into
how an optimization problem may be specified in Geneva. You should thus particularly
look at the GParaboloidIndividual2D class. The main function illustrates additional
ways of specifying the optimization algorithms to be used, and how individuals can
be added to the optimization handler class "go2".

03_GParameterObjectUsagePatterns:
---------------------------------

This sample program illustrates the usage of Geneva's parameter objects.
GParameterObject-derivatives are the main vehicle through which optimization
parameters are specified. There is a whole family of parameter objects.

04_GMultiCriterionParabola:
---------------------------

06_GDirectEA:
-------------

06_GDirectSA:
-------------

06_GDirectSwarm:
-------------

06_GSimpleSwarm:
----------------

07_GFunctionMinimizer:
----------------------

09_GNeuralNetwork:
------------------

10_GStarter:
------------

11_GMetaOptimizer:
------------------

12_GExternalEvaluator:
----------------------

13_GPluggableOptimizationMonitors:
----------------------------------

14_GDependentConstraints:
-------------------------

15_GOpenCLConsumer:
-------------------

16_GMPIConsumer:
----------------

This example shows how the MPI consumer can be used directly within the broker infrastructure without using Go2.
Usually using Go2 is recommended, but this example serves as a demonstration of direct interaction with the broker and
is similar to the example 06_GDirectEA. If you would like to explore the MPI-Consumer with Go2, you can use the example
10_GStarter and call the executable with --help --showAll to explore all options.

17_GMPISubClients:
------------------

This example shows how to use the GMPISubClientOptimizer.
It offers all functionality of Go2 but additionally adds the functionality of
creating MPI-sub-clients, which can be used to parallelize computation on the level
of individuals in a user-defined fashion.


Please check each directory's README for further information. The main source
code file (named similar to the directory it is in) might also prove useful.

Many of the examples are also described in detail in the Geneva manual, see
http://www.gemfony.eu/fileadmin/documentation/geneva-manual.pdf

Compilation
===========

All the examples in this folder are compiled when building the whole Geneva
tree. However, you can also give any of these examples a try by compiling it
"stand-alone", provided the correct version of the Geneva library is available
on your system.

For compiling a given example proceed as follows:

- Create a "build" folder somewhere and change into it:
	mkdir /tmp/build
	cd /tmp/build

- Run cmake with the appropriate options:
	cmake [-DBOOSTROOT=<PATH_TO_BOOST_ROOT>] \
	      [-DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR="${BOOSTROOT}/lib" -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR="${BOOSTROOT}/include"] \
	      -DGENEVA_ROOT=<PATH_TO_GENEVA_INSTALL_DIR> \
	      -DGENEVA_BUILD_TYPE=[Release|Debug] \
	      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH_TO_GENEVA_EXAMPLE_INSTALL_DIR> \
	      -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=[0|1] -DGENEVA_BUILD_TESTS=[0|1] \
	      		<PATH_TO_EXAMPLE_SOURCE_DIR>
  In particular, if the Boost libraries are installed system-wide you will most
  probably only need the GENEVA_ROOT variable and you can simply try with:
	cmake -DGENEVA_ROOT=/opt/geneva \
	      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/geneva-examples geneva-src/examples/GSimpleEA/

- Build and install the example:
	make
	make install
