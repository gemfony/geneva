This directory contains a Geneva application that searches for 
the minimum of a parabola in two dimensions, using variables whose value range 
is constrained. Program options are specified through a configuration file. All
options of the individual are fixed.

The main purpose of this example is to provide users with a first insight into
how an optimization problem may be specified in Geneva. You should thus particularly
look at the GParaboloidIndividual2D class. The main function illustrates additional
ways of specifying the optimization algorithms to be used, and how individuals can 
be added to the optimization handler class "go2".
