/**
 * @file
 * @brief Umbrella header re-exporting the full Geneva plotting stack.
 *
 * GPlotDesigner was split into focused headers under common/plotting/ (D-2). This umbrella keeps
 * existing #include "common/GPlotDesigner.hpp" working; it pulls in the full plotting stack (each
 * plotting header also stands alone and chain-includes its own dependencies). The public plotting
 * API (GPlotDesigner, the GBasePlotter hierarchy, etc.) is declared and documented in
 * common/plotting/GPlotDesigner.hpp and the sibling plotting headers it includes.
