/**
 * A thread pool built entirely from Geneva's own primitives -- a GThreadGroup of
 * worker threads (std::jthread) draining a shared, blocking, multi-producer/
 * multi-consumer task queue (GBlockingMPMCQueueT). It carries no third-party
 * dependency (in particular no Boost.ASIO io_context / work guard) and uses the
 * queue's terminal close() for clean, deadlock-free shutdown -- workers block at
 * ~0 CPU on an empty queue and wake the instant work is submitted or the pool is
 * shut down.
 *
 * Submit work with async_schedule(), which returns a std::future carrying the
 * task's result and any exception it threw; one if-constexpr template body handles
 * both void and non-void return types. When the outcome need not be observed, the
 * fire-and-forget post() schedules a task without allocating a promise/future.
 * wait() blocks until the pool has run empty. Workers are started eagerly in the
 * constructor, so getNThreads() always reports the live worker count.
 *
 * Note: tasks are type-erased through std::move_only_function, so the submitted
 * callable plus its bound arguments only need to be movable, not copyable. Geneva's
 * usage (closures capturing std::shared_ptr) satisfies this. The single-owner task
 * type expresses that a queued task is never copied, only moved to the worker that
 * runs it.
 *
 * This class is neither copyable nor movable (it owns threads, a queue, mutexes
 * and condition variables). wait() / setNThreads() must NOT be called from inside
 * a task running in the pool (and a task must not submit further work while another
 * thread is inside wait()): both would deadlock.
