/**
 * @brief A lock-free ring of @f$N@f$ bulk-filled pools of 64-bit words, kept ahead of an atomic claim
 * cursor by a single background producer.
 *
 * This is a single-producer / multi-consumer staging ring: one background thread bulk-refills @f$N@f$
 * rotating pools ahead of a monotonic claim cursor, and any number of readers claim fixed-size chunks
 * lock-free. Where the words come from is injected as a @ref fill_function (called only from the
 * producer thread and the constructor), so the ring itself is domain-agnostic; it was lifted from the
 * Hap RNG prefetch substrate (the STAGED / QUARANTINE random sources), where a pool is bulk-filled by a
 * SIMD/cuRAND backend. Reads (@ref claimSpan / @ref copyChunkInto) carry no indirection -- the injected
 * callback runs once per pool refill, never on the per-chunk read path.
 *
 * Let @f$W=@f$ @c ChunkWords (words per chunk), @f$C=@f$ @c ChunksPerPool (chunks per pool) and
 * @f$N=@f$ @c NPools. Each pool holds @f$C\cdot W@f$ 64-bit words; the @f$N@f$ pools form a ring.
 *
 * @par Data structure

 *
 * @par Algorithm
 * A claim advances the cursor and decodes it (no lock):
 * @f[
 *   s \;\leftarrow\; \texttt{cursor.fetch\_add}(1), \qquad
 *   g = \left\lfloor s/C \right\rfloor, \quad
 *   k = g \bmod N, \quad
 *   o = (s \bmod C)\,W ,
 * @f]
 * yielding the span @f$\texttt{pools}[k]\,[\,o,\,o+W\,)@f$, which holds pool generation @f$g@f$.
 * The background producer keeps the ring filled ahead of the cursor, maintaining the invariant
 * @f[
 *   \texttt{filled\_seq} \;\ge\; \texttt{lead} + (N-1), \qquad
 *   \texttt{lead} = \left\lfloor \texttt{cursor}/C \right\rfloor ,
 * @f]
 * by bulk-filling one pool at a time (pool @f$ (f\!+\!1)\bmod N @f$ for generation @f$f\!+\!1@f$).
 * It @e never inspects or waits on reader state, so a dormant or dead reader can stall nothing.
 *
 * @par Two read modes (same claim)
 * @li claimSpan() returns a pointer for reading the chunk @e in @e place;
 * @li copyChunkInto() copies the chunk out word-by-word into the caller's private buffer. The copy
 *     uses per-word @c atomic_ref relaxed loads: on x86-64 / AArch64 each lowers to the same plain
 *     aligned move (zero cost), but it keeps the copy strictly per-word -- no wide SIMD load may
 *     straddle the 64-bit granularity the old-or-new guarantee relies on -- and the compiler may not
 *     assume the memory is immutable.
 *
 * @par Benign race condition -- when, and why, it does no harm
 * The single shared-memory hazard is the producer bulk-refilling a pool while a reader still touches
 * it. It is reachable, but harmless, under exactly these conditions:
 * @li @b Atomicity. Every shared cell is an aligned 64-bit word. On the supported architectures
 *     (x86-64, AArch64) an aligned 64-bit load/store is a @e single hardware-atomic instruction, so a
 *     reader observes a clean @b old-or-new value, never a torn half. This is enforced portably by
 *     @c static_assert(@c atomic_ref<uint64_t>::is_always_lock_free) below.
 * @li @b Separation. With @f$N\ge 3@f$ the producer refills a pool @f$\ge N-1@f$ generations ahead of
 *     an @e active reader's pool, so they never coincide; an overlap requires a reader descheduled
 *     across a @e full rotation (@f$\ge (N\!-\!1)\,C@f$ chunks) -- astronomically unlikely.
 * @li @b Benign @b even @b then. Should the overlap occur, by the atomicity condition every individual
 *     word is still a valid value; the only effect is mixing two generations of words. Whether that is
 *     acceptable is the caller's contract -- it holds for the RNG staging use this was lifted from.
 * @li @b No @b deadlock. There are no locks and the producer never blocks on reader state.
 *
 * It is @e formally still a data race, so the pool storage is marked with @c AnnotateBenignRaceSized
 * (see the file-top note); a ThreadSanitizer build then reports zero races while all assertions pass.
 *
 * @tparam ChunkWords     Words per claimed chunk (@f$W@f$)
 * @tparam ChunksPerPool  Chunks per pool (@f$C@f$; pool size @f$=W\cdot C@f$ words)
 * @tparam NPools         Number of rotating pools (@f$N@f$; must be @f$\ge 3@f$ for the quarantine)
