 * orchestration pool, Hap's RNG producers, the clients' compute pools); this is
 * the one place that sums them.
 *
 * The budget does ACCOUNTING AND ADVICE, not scheduling: reserve() never blocks,
 * never throws and never refuses a request. In the current (P0) stage every
 * reservation is granted in full and the budget's only behavioural surface is a
 * rate-limited warning, naming the largest reservations, when the reserved total
 * crosses a multiple of the hardware ceiling (today: silent oversubscription).
 * The recorded ThreadElasticity is the seam for the later elastic-granting stage
 * (P1), in which a NESTED elastic pool receives min(desired, remaining budget)
 * -- see the design note in the P1 documentation before enabling it: shrinking
 * must be limited to nested reservations, or construction order would starve a
 * legitimate top-level pool.
 *
 * Thread-safe; all operations are short mutex-protected critical sections taken
 * at pool construction/teardown, never on a hot path.
