/**
 * A one-shot "wait for N completions" latch: one party arms it with a count, N worker parties each call
 * @c count_down() exactly once when their unit of work finishes, and one waiter blocks in @c wait() until
 * the count reaches zero. It replaces the hand-rolled per-batch @c atomic + @c mutex + @c condition_variable
 * triple (e.g. a thread-pool consumer waiting for one batch's items while the pool is shared across batches).
 *
 * @par Lifetime (important)
 * The waiter's predicate (@c remaining_ == 0) is satisfied by the atomic decrement in @c count_down(), which
 * happens BEFORE that last worker takes the internal mutex to notify. So @c wait() can return -- and its
 * caller may destroy this object -- while the last worker is still about to lock the mutex, which would lock
 * freed memory (a use-after-scope). Therefore a latch shared between workers and a waiter must be kept alive
 * by ALL of them, e.g. held via a @c std::shared_ptr captured by every worker task and by the waiter, so it
 * outlives the last @c count_down(). Do not stack-allocate it across that boundary.
 *
 * The latch is re-armable (@c arm()) for reuse once a previous round has fully completed.
