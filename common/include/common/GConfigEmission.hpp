/**
 * @brief The uniform "emit my configuration files" entry point for every config-owning binary.
 *
 * A Geneva binary's registered parameters and their defaults are the single source of truth for its
 * configuration; the shipped `config/*.json` files are just a materialized cache of what the code
 * already knows. To materialize them at build/install time, a binary is run with the
 * @c --update-configs command-line switch: it puts GParserBuilder into update-in-place mode (so every
 * config it subsequently parses is created-if-absent and rewritten in canonical form), constructs
 * each of its config owners so their parse fires, and exits without optimizing.
 *
 * @c Go2 binaries already do this internally (Go2 consumes @c --update-configs and refreshes every
 * factory/individual config it owns). These helpers give the **non-Go2** mains (the direct-OA
 * examples, the parameter-object demo, the benchmarks, the manual tests) the exact same behaviour
 * behind the exact same switch, so a single build step can drive @c "<binary> --update-configs" over
 * every config-owning target uniformly.
 *
 * Usage in a non-Go2 main(), immediately after GenevaInitializer and before the binary's own option
 * parser runs:
 * @code
 *   GenevaInitializer gi;
 *   if(Gem::Common::configEmissionRequested(argc, argv)) {
 *       Gem::Common::beginConfigEmission();
 *       // Construct (and, if the parse is lazy, exercise) every config owner this binary uses:
 *       gind::GFunctionIndividualFactory("./config/GFunctionIndividual.json").get();
 *       Gem::Common::finishConfigEmission(); // logs and exits(0)
 *   }
 * @endcode
