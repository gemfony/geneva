 * localMembers_() is the single, per-class declaration of a class's own data
 * members (a tuple of named references). It is kept private in every class,
 * exactly as the hand-written serialize()/load_()/compare_() were. The mixins
 * below live in the base class and therefore cannot see a derived class's
 * private members directly, so each managed class grants friendship to this one
 * empty struct (a single `friend struct Gem::Common::GReflectiveInterfaceAccess;` line,
 * replacing the `friend class boost::serialization::access;` line the folded
 * serialize() used to need). Routing every access through this single shim keeps
 * the friendship declaration short and identical across all managed classes.

/**
 * @brief Generates the name_()/load_()/compare_() members (and the folded
 * serialize()) shared by every class in a GCommonInterfaceT hierarchy.
 *
 * This is the base half of the reflective-interface mixin, used directly by *abstract*
 * classes (those whose clone_() stays pure) and inherited by GReflectiveInterfaceT for
 * *concrete* classes. It derives from the class's real Parent and inserts no
 * data of its own, so it is transparent to Boost.Serialization: the folded
 * serialize() writes base_object<Parent> (skipping this stateless layer) plus
 * the class's own members, exactly as the hand-written code did.
 *
 * The three overriders and the folded serialize() are single-sourced here from
 * the managed class's localMembers_() declaration, so a class can no longer
 * silently drop a member from one of the four (the failure mode Inv 4 exists to
 * prevent). Everything that varies is a template parameter or is recovered from
 * the hierarchy:
 *  - the load_() parameter type / the interface base is Root, recovered from
 *    Parent::gemfony_common_root_t;
 *  - the class name comes from Derived::class_name;
 *  - the member list comes from Derived::localMembers_().
 *
 * The root of a hierarchy (Parent == GCommonInterfaceT<Root>) is handled by the
 * two `if constexpr` guards: it has no serializable/loadable parent slice, but
 * its compare_() still compares the GCommonInterfaceT base (the non-pure
 * same-type overload), matching the hand-written root behaviour.
 *
 * All member bodies are instantiated lazily (when the vtable is emitted / the
 * archive is used), by which point Derived is complete -- the same reason the
 * pre-existing name_/clone_ generators (GGenomeT, GOptimizationAlgorithmT, ...)
 * can name Derived's constructor from a CRTP base.
