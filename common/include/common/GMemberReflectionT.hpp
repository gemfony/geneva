/**
 * Single-source-of-truth machinery for a GCommonInterfaceT subclass's local data members.
 *
 * A class declares its local members exactly once through a localMembers() pair
 * (const + non-const) that returns a tuple of descriptors (a name plus a reference
 * to the member). serialize(), load_() and compare_() then all derive their
 * behaviour from that single declaration -- via serialize_members(),
 * g_load_members() and g_compare_members() -- instead of each function enumerating
 * the members separately. This removes the "added a member but forgot to update
 * load_()/compare_()" class of bugs.
 *
 * How a member participates is factored into THREE INDEPENDENT AXES, each chosen by
 * a small policy:
 *
 *  - serialize : ser_emit (through the archive by NVP) | ser_skip (omit);
 *  - load      : load_assign (plain =) | load_clone_ptr | load_clone_container
 *                (deep clone) | load_atomic (.store(.load()));
 *  - compare   : cmp_value (compare_t / getIdentity) | cmp_atomic (compare the
 *                loaded value) | cmp_skip (not part of comparable identity).
 *
 * A descriptor (member_desc) composes one policy per axis; the make_* factories
 * name the combinations actually in use (member_t, cloneable_member_t, atomic_member_t,
 * load_only_member_t, transient_member_t). Because the axes are orthogonal, a new
 * participation pattern is a new factory line -- NOT a new descriptor type carrying
 * a fresh set of g_serialize_one / g_load_one / g_compare_one overloads. The three
 * g_*_one dispatchers are each written once and forward to the relevant policy.
 *
 * This header holds the descriptors, the serialize and load policies (whose
 * dependencies live here) and the serialize/load derivations. The compare
 * derivation lives in GExpectationChecksT.hpp (it depends on the comparison DSL);
 * the compare axis is represented here by opaque tag types only, on which
 * g_compare_one() there dispatches.
