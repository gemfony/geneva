/**
 * @file overlays.cpp
 * @brief Two plotters sharing one pad, and the two plot modes. A primary series of
 * noisy "measured" points (drawn as a SCATTER) is overlaid with a secondary series
 * holding the smooth "fit" (drawn as a CURVE) via overlaySeries(). Rendered through
 * the graph-capable backends (ROOT and gnuplot).
