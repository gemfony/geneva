 * @brief The CLOSED frame vocabulary of the networked consumer/worker session protocol -- the part of a
 * message courtier itself acts on.
 *
 * A frame says what the message does to the *transport*: pull for work, hand work out, check a result
 * back in, shut a worker down, fetch a blob. What the message MEANS to the using library (evaluate this,
 * here are the results, …) is not expressed here: it rides the frame as an opaque library tag plus a
 * library-defined payload that courtier relays without interpreting (see GCommandContainerT).
 *
 * BLOB_REQUEST / BLOB_REPLY form the blob-send-once cache-miss fetch: a worker that receives a work item
 * referencing a blob id it does not hold asks the server for it (BLOB_REQUEST), and the server answers
 * from its own registry (BLOB_REPLY). Both are served entirely inside courtier, hence frames rather than
 * library tags.
 *
 * NONE is the cleared/default state of a frame container, never a transmitted frame.
