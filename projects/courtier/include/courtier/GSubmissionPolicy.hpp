 * always reconciles the span against this policy and guarantees a valid, full-size population on
 * return -- or terminates fatally when the policy cannot be honoured.
 *
 * Two failure kinds are distinguished per slot:
 *  - MISSING  : the item never came back (network loss, timeout, dead client).
 *  - FAILED   : the item came back flagged (its evaluation threw/crashed).
 * A MISSING item that never returns despite repeated resubmissions (max_resubmissions) is likely a
 * *poison* individual that crashes the client; once its resubmission budget is exhausted it becomes
 * unresolved rather than being resubmitted forever (see GBaseConsumerT::processBatch).
