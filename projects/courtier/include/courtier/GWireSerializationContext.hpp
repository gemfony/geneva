/**
 * The transport-side BLOB SEND-ONCE machinery. When a using library ships work items that each carry a
 * copy of the same large, immutable payload, re-sending that payload with every item dominates the wire
 * size. This header provides the TRANSPORT-AGNOSTIC plumbing that lets a serializer send each distinct
 * payload once and reference it by a content id thereafter, with a mandatory cache-miss -> fetch fallback
 * for networked transports (reconnect / late-joining workers).
 *
 * It lives in the courtier (consumer/session) layer so all three transports -- Asio, websocket, MPI --
 * inherit it once, and it knows NOTHING about what a blob contains: a blob is an OPAQUE serialized string
 * keyed by an opaque 128-bit content id. The USING LIBRARY computes the id, (de)serializes its own payload
 * to/from the blob, and consults the thread-local context set around a (de)serialization; courtier owns
 * the registry and the session-scoped bookkeeping (which peer already holds which blob, eviction),
 * because session lifetime is a courtier concern. Courtier therefore carries this payload without
 * interpreting it -- it never learns what the bytes mean.
 *
 * (Geneva is the current user: it interns a flat genome's shared, immutable structural layout, which is
 * identical across an entire population. That is one application of the mechanism, not its definition.)
 *
 * Checkpoint / file serialization does NOT use this machinery (a checkpoint must stay self-contained):
 * it is engaged only when a transport establishes a GWireSerializationScope around the wire encoding.
