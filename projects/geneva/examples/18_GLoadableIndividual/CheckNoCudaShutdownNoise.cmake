# Regression guard for the GCudaRNG teardown race (projects/hap/src/GCUDARng.cu).
#
# At process exit the CUDA runtime unloads (atexit) while the GRandomFactory's producer threads may still be
# refilling on the GPU. cuRAND reports that as a generic CURAND_STATUS_LAUNCH_FAILURE which -- before the fix
# -- was printed to stderr as "GCudaRNG: cuRAND call failed (...)", because the cuRAND error path could not
# recognise shutdown on its own. The race is non-deterministic (about 40% of runs on the reference machine),
# so this guard runs the reproducer many times and fails if the noise appears in ANY run. It is registered
# only when the CUDA RNG backend is built (GENEVA_USE_CUDA_RNG_ENABLED) -- the defect cannot occur otherwise.
#
# Driven via `cmake -P` with -DBIN, -DPLUGIN, -DWORKDIR and optionally -DRUNS.
