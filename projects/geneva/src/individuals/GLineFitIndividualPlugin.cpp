/**
 * @file
 * @brief Module "glue" that makes GLineFitIndividual a runtime-loadable Geneva individual.
 *
 * This translation unit is compiled into the module .so ONLY (never the object library): it holds the fixed
 * extern "C" entry point geneva_module_manifest(), whose symbol name is fixed for the loader's dlsym and so
 * must be unique per process. It deliberately does NOT re-emit the individual's BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT -- that
 * lives once in GLineFitIndividual.cpp (the individual's own, compiled into both the module and any
 * compile-in consumer), so there is exactly one serialization-GUID registration per type.
 *
 * The manifest itself is built by the typed helper individualManifest<Factory, Config, Name>(): the factory
 * is the standard config-driven flat-individual factory on GLineFitIndividual (which reads its data-point
 * file from the named config), the config path is auto-created with the individual's defaults if absent, and
 * the name is used for diagnostics.
