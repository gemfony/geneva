# GENEVA_TEST_SIZE(<test-name> <S|M|L|XL>)
#
# Gives a registered CTest test its SIZE label -- the one label the gates select on.
# Every registered test carries exactly one; the semantic labels it also carries
# (the owning library, `example`, `benchmark`) stay purely informational.
#
# The rule for choosing the letter, the boundaries, and what the gates do with it
# are documented in ONE place: the "Running the test suite" section of INSTALL.
# This file deliberately does not restate them.
