# Build-time config materialization (GENEVA_MATERIALIZE_CONFIGS). The function
# body lives in this shared, installable module so the SAME mechanism is
# available to an out-of-tree project that consumes an installed Geneva via
# find_package(Geneva) -- GenevaConfig.cmake includes it, exactly like the
# individual-packaging helpers in GenevaIndividualModule.cmake. It expects
# GenevaRunQuiet.cmake to sit next to this file (both in-tree in CMakeModules/
# and in the installed package directory).

# GENEVA_MATERIALIZE_CONFIGS(<target> <install-config-dest>)
#
# Wires a config-owning binary so its configuration directory is MATERIALIZED FROM CODE at build time
# rather than copied from a hand-maintained set of shipped files. After <target> is built it is run once
# with --update-configs, which (re)creates its configuration files from the code's registered defaults
# into <build-dir>/config; that directory's intentional overrides (config/config-overrides.json in the
# source tree, if present) are then overlaid onto them via the GConfigOverlay helper. The materialized
# directory is installed to <install-config-dest> (pass an empty string to skip installation).
#
# Any extra arguments after <install-dest> are passed to the binary before --update-configs (e.g. a
# plugin loader's "--individual <plugin.so>"); if such an argument references another target via a
# $<TARGET_FILE:...> genex, make <target> depend on it so it is built first.
#
# This replaces the former per-directory FILE(COPY config) + INSTALL(FILES ...). It MUST be called from
# the same CMakeLists.txt that defines <target>, because a POST_BUILD command may only be attached to a
# target in the current directory -- i.e. in place of the former ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(config).
#
# The binaries run here emit their normal runtime output (GLogger notes about created config files
# etc.); to keep that from interleaving with the build output, each run is routed through the
# GenevaRunQuiet.cmake helper, which captures stdout+stderr to a log file in the target's build
# directory and replays it only if the run fails.
