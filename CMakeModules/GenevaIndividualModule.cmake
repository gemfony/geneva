# Individual-packaging CMake helpers: GENEVA_ADD_INDIVIDUAL_MODULE and
# GENEVA_DECLARE_INDIVIDUAL. These build an optimization individual as a
# compiled-in object library and/or a runtime-loadable shared MODULE.
#
# This module is SHARED between the in-tree Geneva build (included from
# CommonGenevaBuild.cmake) and the INSTALLED CMake package (included from the
# generated GenevaConfig.cmake), so an out-of-tree project that consumes an
# installed Geneva via find_package(Geneva) gets the same packaging helpers.
#
# The Geneva header search paths are NOT hard-coded here (they differ between the
# in-tree source layout and an installed prefix). The includer MUST set
#
#   GENEVA_INDIVIDUAL_INCLUDE_DIRS
#
# to the include directories of the Geneva collection (common/hap/courtier/
# dietrich/geneva) before including this file. Boost's include dirs
# (${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS}) and the caller's own source directory
# (${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}) are added per-invocation (call time), so Boost
# need only be found by the time an individual is actually declared.

	# The packaging declaration for a Geneva optimization individual. It encodes the maintainer's DA1b model:

	# the author's hand-written GEM_REGISTER_ARCHIVABLE, one per serialized type, in the individual's own cpp).
	#
	#   MODE compile  -> an OBJECT library <name>-obj built from SOURCES. A binary that COMPILES the individual
	#                    in links this target, so the individual's GEM_REGISTER_ARCHIVABLE static
	#                    initializers (archive-tag registration) are pulled in and never stripped.
	#   MODE load     -> a shared MODULE lib<name>.so built from SOURCES + the PLUGIN glue TU. It links NONE of
	#                    the Geneva libraries (their symbols resolve from the host process at load via
	#                    RTLD_GLOBAL; only their headers are needed) and is loaded at runtime via --individual.
	#   MODE both     -> both of the above; the module reuses the object library's compiled objects

	#
	# The PLUGIN glue TU (the fixed extern "C" geneva_module_manifest() entry point) is compiled into the

	# links two individuals must not contain two definitions of it. Hence SOURCES = the individual (class +
	# export, in both targets) and PLUGIN = the glue (module only). The ONE hard rule the author must honour
	# (not enforceable in CMake): a single PROCESS must never both compile-in and load the same individual --
	# Geneva allows exactly one optimization problem per process and refuses the second claim, naming both.
	#
	# CONFIG, when given, is recorded on the module target (property GENEVA_INDIVIDUAL_CONFIG) for downstream
