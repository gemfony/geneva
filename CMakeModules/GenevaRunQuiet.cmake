# Script mode (cmake -P) helper: runs a command with its stdout and stderr
# captured to a log file, so a chatty-but-successful run does not clobber the
# build output. If the command fails, the captured output is replayed in full
# and the build step fails. Used by GENEVA_MATERIALIZE_CONFIGS to run the
# freshly built config-owning binaries (whose GLogger notes and warnings are
# runtime output, intentionally unchanged at the code level).
#
# Expected -D definitions:
#   RQ_CMD  -- the command and its arguments, joined with '|' (an argument may
#              contain spaces but not '|'); pass executables as absolute paths
#              or $<TARGET_FILE:...> expansions, not bare target names
#   RQ_WD   -- the working directory for the command
#   RQ_LOG  -- absolute path of the log file receiving stdout+stderr
#   RQ_DESC -- one-line description of the step, used in the failure message
