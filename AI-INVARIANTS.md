# AI Invariants

Mandatory rules for **AI-driven work** in this repository — orchestration, model selection, and the
division of labour between AI tiers. They complement [`DEVELOPMENT-INVARIANTS.md`](DEVELOPMENT-INVARIANTS.md),
which binds **all** work (human or AI) and remains the sole source of the engineering invariants; nothing
here weakens or duplicates a rule there. Every AI working in this repository reads **both** files before
making any change. An AI invariant is changed only by an explicit maintainer decision, recorded here.

(Cross-check 2026-07-26: no invariant in `DEVELOPMENT-INVARIANTS.md` is purely AI-specific — all bind human
and AI work alike — so none was moved; this file starts with the rules below.)

## AI-1. The sweep rule — supervision, mechanical work, and intermediate work run on different tiers

Large parallel efforts are split by the kind of judgment they need, and each kind runs on the tier suited
to it:

- **Mechanical work → Haiku (many agents in parallel).** High-volume, pattern-shaped detection: scanning
  for stale vocabulary, copy-paste identity errors, narration comments, convention drift, sibling
  asymmetries. Mechanical scanners are *detection-only*: they never change code, never decide fixes, and
  every finding must carry the repo-relative file, line, and a **verbatim quote** (the machine-validation
  hook — a finding whose quote does not match the tree is discarded unread).
- **Intermediate work → Sonnet or Opus (one fresh agent per phase).** Executing a reviewed design or plan
  phase: gated refactors, implementation, test writing, per-phase handoff documents.
- **Supervision → Fable (the supervising model).** Design review, ruling preparation for the maintainer,
  independent gate verification before any push, and — critically — **verification of every load-bearing
  finding** a lower tier produced. The supervisor reads the code itself; it does not vote on summaries.

*Why:* the tiers fail differently. Haiku is reliable at pattern detection and unreliable at judgment —
its severity labels are noise and its design/concurrency claims are often confidently wrong; Fable's
attention is the scarce resource and is spent where wrongness is expensive. Matching work to tier makes
the sweep both cheap and safe; mismatching it produces either wasted tokens or plausible-but-wrong changes.

## AI-2. Scanner findings are evidence, never actions

No fix, migration, or deletion is ever executed from a mechanical scan result alone:

- Quotes are validated mechanically against the tree before a finding is even read.
- Scanner severity labels are **untrusted**; the supervisor re-classifies.
- Any finding whose fix would touch behaviour — concurrency, ownership, protocol, ABI, public API — is
  verified **at the supervisor tier, in the code**, before it becomes work. Calibration from the first
  sweep (2026-07-26): of ~15 scanner claims that mutex use violated Invariant 2, **zero** survived
  supervisor verification as migrations — the "violations" were bespoke coordination logic, deliberately
  leaked registries, and plain data guards. Executing them blindly would have damaged the most delicate
  infrastructure in the tree.
- "Unused" claims from scanners compose with Invariants 11 and 23: they are input for a maintainer
  exposure decision, never a licence to delete.

## AI-3. One writer in the checkout; fresh contexts; all state in files

At most **one** AI agent writes in the working tree at a time (read-only work may run in parallel). Each
plan phase is executed by a **fresh** agent that inherits no conversation state; everything a successor
needs lives in persistent files — the active plan with its progress ledger, the per-phase handoff
documents, and the git history. An agent's context is perishable by design; work that exists only in a
conversation does not exist.

## AI-4. AI work is never attributed in the repository

Commit messages, code comments, and documentation carry **no** AI attribution of any kind: no
`Co-Authored-By` trailers naming an AI, no "Generated with …" lines, no session links, no model names in
prose. The git author is the maintainer; the work stands on its own.

## AI-5. The supervisor verifies gates independently before anything is pushed

An executing agent's green report is a claim, not a fact. Before a push, the supervising tier re-runs or
independently confirms the gates (build exit codes, warning greps, test counts, the dlopen/e2e evidence
appropriate to the change) on the actual trees. The false-green discipline of the engineering invariants
(separate configure/make/ctest exit codes; a stale tree proves nothing) applies to this verification
exactly as to the original run.

*Add new AI invariants below as the maintainer establishes them. Keep each rule short, mandatory, and
about HOW AI work is organized — engineering rules for the code itself belong in
`DEVELOPMENT-INVARIANTS.md`.*
