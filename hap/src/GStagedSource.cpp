/**
 * @brief Copies one chunk of fresh random words out of the process-wide staging pool.
 *
 * The pool is a function-local static, constructed on the first claim (after the
 * random factory exists) and shared by every STAGED proxy. It is the same
 * lock-free rotating-block ring the QUARANTINE source uses, but STAGED copies the
 * claimed chunk out (word-by-word, each an aligned 64-bit atomic load) into the
 * caller's private double buffer: after the copy the proxy serves from its own
 * memory and touches the pool no further, so a dormant STAGED proxy is fully
 * race-free (it pins no shared memory). This replaces the earlier mutex-guarded
 * single-buffer pool, removing the lock that serialised proxies under load.
 *
 * @param dst Start of the destination buffer (must hold at least n words)
 * @param n   Number of 64-bit words to copy out (must equal STAGED_CHUNK_WORDS)
