/**
 * @brief Process-lifetime guard that brackets the global random-number factory around main().
 *
 * A single object with static storage duration, living in the hap library. It is constructed during
 * this shared library's dynamic initialization -- i.e. BEFORE main() -- and destroyed at library
 * unload / static teardown -- i.e. AFTER main() returns. Its constructor brings the factory online and
 * its destructor finalizes it exactly once (joining the producer threads and closing the buffers).
 *
 * Making the factory's finalize the responsibility of this ONE library-global -- rather than of every
 * GenevaInitializer / Go2, as it used to be -- is what keeps a short-lived Go2 from tearing the shared
 * factory down mid-run (a finalized factory can never hand out another random-number container, so
 * every later consumer would spin/throw; see GenevaInitializer's destructor and
 * GRandomT::getNewRandomContainer()). finalize() is idempotent, so the factory's own destructor calling
 * it again when the singleton storage is released is a harmless no-op.
 *
 * Ordering is correct by construction: because the RNG consumers (libgemfony-geneva et al.) depend on
 * this library, their statics are destroyed BEFORE this guard's destructor runs, so nothing still draws
 * random numbers when the producers are joined. And because the guard's constructor lazily builds the
 * factory singleton, that singleton's storage completes construction during this guard's construction
 * and is therefore destroyed AFTER it -- so randomFactory() is still valid inside the guard's
 * destructor. (This relies on hap being a shared library, whose object files are all loaded; if hap is
 * ever linked statically and this TU's guard is dropped by the linker, behaviour falls back to the
 * factory being finalized by its own singleton destructor -- correct, just less deterministically
 * timed. No functional regression either way.)
